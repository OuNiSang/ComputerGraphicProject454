CISC/CMPE 454 Assignment 4

Due Friday, April 8 at noon

In this assignment, you will implement transparency and caustic photon
maps in a raytracer.  You may work in groups of two.  Graduate
students must work individually.

0. Get the code compiling.  Then run the code using an argument of

     ../worlds/basic.txt

   for a basic scene.  Press '?' in the window to get a list of UI
   options printed in the terminal.  Play around with the program.
   Move the viewpoint.  Get the program to show you the rays it's
   tracing.  Try the other scenes in the 'worlds' directory.

   Read and understand the code in scene.cpp and photonmap.cpp.

1. Implement transparency where you see "YOUR CODE HERE" and a comment
   about transparency.  You need transparency working completely
   before starting photon maps.

2. Implement photon maps where you see "YOUR CODE HERE" and a comment
   about photon maps.


To Hand In

  Make a directory called 'a4'.  In that directory include

    - scene.cpp, scene.h, photonmap.cpp, photonmap.h

    - a README.txt file with your name(s) and netID(s).

    - two screen captured images of your program output, showing
      working transparency and working photon maps from your own code.

    - DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OTHER FILES.  YOUR a4 DIRECTORY SHOULD
      CONTAIN EXACTLY 7 FILES.  YOU WILL LOSE MARKS OTHERWISE.

  Create a ZIP archive of the a4 directory and upload it to OnQ.

  IN GROUPS OF TWO, ONLY ONE PERSON SHOULD UPLOAD THE ASSIGNMENT.  YOU
  WILL LOSE MARKS IF BOTH OF YOUR SUBMIT THE ASSIGNMENT.
